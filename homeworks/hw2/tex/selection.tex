\Claim \textsc{SelectK}$(A[1\ldots n], B[1\ldots m], k)$ returns the $kth$
ranked value in the union of the two arrays.

\begin{proof}
    Merge two array into one, sort this new array, then the $kth$ element
    in this array is the $kth$ ranked value in the union of the two arrays.
    The two array is sorted in the first place. Thus, in the For-Loop
    shown in \cref{selectK}, the smaller element in two array is put into
    the new array. Therefore, when the For-Loop finishes, the new array
    would be a sorted array.

    Thus, Return the $kth$ element in the new array will give the $kth$ ranked value
    in the union of the two arrays.
\end{proof}

In \cref{selectK}, there is one For-Loop with only constant time operation in each loop.
Thus the running time of \textsc{SelectK} is $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$.
