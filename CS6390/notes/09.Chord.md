> A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications

Motivation: How to find data in a distributed file sharing system?

- Centralized: Napster
    + Simple centralized scheme
    + Use a centralized index database. Servers contact the index node to
      upload their list of content at initialization
    + To locate a file
        1. Send a query to central index node
        1. Get the list of peer locations storing the file
    + Fetch the file directly from one of the peers.
- Flooding(Distributed): Gnutella
    + Find a node to get onto the system
    + To find a file
        1. Broadcast request to all neighbors
        1. On receiving a request, if don’t have the file  Re-broadcast to
           other neighbors
        1. If have the file, pass the info to the requester
- Partial Flooding(Distributed): FastTrack (aka Kazaa)


You can only __overshoot__ if the key is between yourself and your successor.

With high probability, take O(logN) N = number of nodes ___on ring___j



True upper bound:

- If tables are not accurate, N
- Assume tables are accurate, M (M bit)
