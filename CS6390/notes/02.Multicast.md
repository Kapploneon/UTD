## Multicast semantics
- Multicast *group*
    + Is represented by a class D IP address (more later)
    + Zero or more receivers from a multicast group
    + __Senders are not part of the group__
- *Open group semantics*
    + Receivers can join/leave at will.
    + Anyone knowing group address can send to it.
- IP based *best effort delivery* semantics: supports UDP only - no TCP!
    + If routers are reliable per-hop, this requires lots of buffer/state at
      each router
    + Otherwise, if source receives ack's from the receivers, we have ack
      implosion problem.

### Open group semantics
- Advantages
    + Sources do not need to know individual receivers (they just send).
    + Receivers do not need to know the sources either.
- Disadvantages
    + Difficult to protect from unauthorized senders/receivers.

### Forwarding State is _Dynamic_
- __Created__ when receivers join a multicast group and when sources send
  packets addressed to the group.
- __Deleted__ after receivers leave a multicast group or senders stop sending
  packets addressed to the group.

## Multicast Tree Construction
Building forwarding trees between sources and receivers. In general there are
three ways:

- Flood and prune:
    + Begin by flooding traffic to entire network (Create a broadcast tree).
    + Prune branches with no receivers.

  Some examples of this way: DVMRP, PIM-DM.

  Disadvantages:
    + unwanted (prune) state in routers not on the multicast tree.
    + Initial flood consume network bandwidth.

- Link-state multicast protocols:
    + Routers advertise groups for which they have senders/receivers to entire
      network.
    + Compute trees on demand.

  An example: MOSPF.

  Disadvantages:
    + Link-state is not scalable.
    + Unwanted state in routers not on the multicast tree.

- Receiver driven:
    + Tree is built from the receivers up towards the tree root.
    + Disadvantage: path from source to receiver may not be optimal.

# Bridges and Extended LANs Review
- LANs have physical limitations (e.g., 2500m)
- Bridges connect two or more LAN segments (i.e. collision domains) together.
  They are *transparent* to hosts (does not change packets in any way).
    + Bridges see all messages in their attached LANs.
    + Copy message from one LAN to another if necessary.
- Bridge maintains a forwarding table.
    + Often incomplete (initially empty!)
    + Learn table entries based on source address of messages seen (not the
      destination address).
    + If destination is not on table, forward over all other ports. If answer
      receive, bridge would knows the destination of the previous message
      (throuth the source of the answer message).
    + Entries won't last forever, because host may move from one place to
      another.
- Bridges run a distributed spanning tree algorithm.

## Multicast in Extended LANs
A simple way: bridges propagate multicast packets across every segment of the
extended LAN. But way too inefficient, especially for multicast applications
with sparsely located receivers.

The question is: How to locate receivers? If bridges know which interface leads
to members of a given group, they will forward the packets on those interfaces
only. But, in general, bridges learn the interface when receivers send
something. Yet, the receiver might not send anything.

To learn the location of receivers, we force receivers (i.e., group members) to
periodically transmit a membership-report, with the form of:

- LAN source address = `G`,
- LAN destination address = `ALL-BRIDGES` multicast address.

## Bridge Multicast Table.
- A bridge receiving a report records the incoming interface of the report as
  an outgoing interface for group G.
- It then forwards the report over all of its interfaces in the extended LAN.

## Bridge algorithm (summary)
1. If a packet arrives and its source address is a multicast group,
    1. record arriving interface as an outgoing-interface with an age of zero
       for this multicast address,
    1. and forward to all other interfaces (flood).
1. Periodically increment age of outgoing interface of each group,
    1. when `age = expiry` threshold, delete this outgoing-interface info from
       the group's entry.
    1. If no outgoing-interfaces remain, delete the entire entry for the group.
1. If a packet arrives with a multicast destination address, forward a copy on
   every outgoing-interface recorded in the table entry for that address
   excluding the arriving interface.

## Some Improvements
In the algorithm, if a LAN segment have many host in one group, then all of
them would send membership-report. But the bridges connecting to that LAN
segment only need one report to record the outgoing-interface in table, which
leads to some waste.

Thus, an efficient improvement to suppress unnecessary membership reports:

- Hosts send membership-reports as `(G,G)`, rather than `(G, ALL-BRIDGES)`.
- Then members of group `G` in the same LAN will not send a report if they
  receive the first membership-report.
  All the member in the same LAN will receive the membership-report because to
  join group `G`, their local network card is programmed to receive packets with
  destination address of `G`.

- Bridge on receiving a packet with address `(G,G)`, will changes it to
  `(G, ALL-BRIDGES)` and forwards to other interfaces.
  __This change is vital.__

# Intra-Domain Multicast Routing
## Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)
### Basic Idea
Compute a `spanning (i.e. broadcast) tree` across all the links and prune it to
become a multicast tree. Specifically, a source-based shortest path spanning
tree. Tree is rooted at the source site. It corresponds to *shortest path from
each receiver to the source*.

__Observation:__ Every shortest-path multicast tree rooted at the sender is a
subtree of a single shortest-path spanning (i.e. broadcast) tree rooted at this
sender.

### Reverse Path Flooding (RPF) algorithm
This is not a standard protocol, is just a general method to do broadcast
(actually, flooding a message) using the broadcast tree predefined by the
unicast routing tables.

When a router receives a broadcast packet from source S:

- If the packet *arrives via the next-hop router to S*, then forward the packet
  to all outgoing interfaces (except the incoming one, of course),
- Otherwise, throw the packet away.

You don't need to keep track of a history of messages forwarded.

#### Problems with Original RPF
When multi-access (shared) links (Ethernet) are used between routers, one LAN
may receive multiple messages forwarded by different routers.

### Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB)
__Object:__ eliminates duplicate broadcasts on shared links in RPF.
In order to do that, a router *R* should determine,
for each LAN ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda):

- Is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda) the parent of R on the tree?
  -- so that the router accept the message.
- Is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda) a child of R on the tree?
  -- so that the router would copy the message
  to LAN ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda).

__Some note:__ as long as the message comes from the LAN (to which next hop
belongs), will inherit the message whichever comes.

Routers in the same LAN should know each other's cost to the source S.
This is achieved by distance vector routing.
Since in distance vector routing, each router would broadcast its own distance
vector to its connected LAN so that routers within that LAN would know the
distance vectors of each other. (P34).

The information should be pre-computed so that messages forwarding would not be
delayed.

Add a Children Bitmap to each routing table entry (i.e. each destination LAN
could be a possible source LAN Ls).

We take advantage that we already have a unicast routing table with an entry
per LAN and who tells us who the next hop (parent) is.

### Pruning the Tree
Both RPF and RPB are broadcast algorithms. To provide shortest path multicast
delivery from source S to group members, broadcast tree of S must be pruned
back to reach only links with receivers.

#### Truncated Reverse-Path Broadcast (TRPB)
An alternative in which only non-member leaf LANs are deleted from each
broadcast tree: a router truncates a child link if

- no router uses this link to receive multicast messages from the source (i.e.,
  it is a *leaf LAN*)
- No host is a group member on this link (*non-member LAN*)

Distance vectors only tells the distance not the next hop, so we use DV with
split-horizon and poisoned reverse, that if _at least one router_ gives me a
distance of _infinity_, then it uses my LAN as the next hop.

__DV with split-horizon and poisoned reverse.__ -- ___Lie to you next hop.___

Leaf pruning requires that routers add a leaf bitmap to each routing table
entry (i.e. for each possible source)

#### Routing Table Example

| Destination | Next Hop| Cost | Children Bitmap | Leaf Bitmap |
| :---: | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Ls | .. | .. | 01011 | 00011 |

### Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM)
Based on TRPB, __Leaf Routers with *no attached members*__ send a
__*non membership report* (NMR)__ to the parent router on the LAN.
If a router receives NMR from all of its children routers and itself has no
directly attached members, then it also send NMR to its parent router on the
tree.

Of course, NMR report include an age field, when it expires data flows all the
way to leaves again and gets re-prunec back.

Furthermore, routers remember NMR reports that they sent, so that when a new
host joins _G_, then send a cancellation message to undo the effect of NMR.

### Pros and Cons
Reverse path multicasting, when used with distance vector
routing, is known as distance-vector multicast routing protocol (DVMRP)

- Advantages: good when there are many receivers, since multicast messages are
  initially flooded to the entire network.
- Disadvantages:
    + Bad if there are few receivers.
    + The _path from source to receiver may not be optimal_ if the cost of
      links is not bi-directional.


## Extended OSPF (MOSPF)

### A quick review
A router X generate its link state advertisement periodically.

| X | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| La | 20 |
| Lb | 15 |
| Lc | 5 |
| Ld | 10 |

Send group membership information in OSPF link state advertisement (LSA)
message.

Each router can (when necessary) compute the minimum cost path from every
source to the current set of receivers of the multicast group. But if the
router precompute, for every group G, a tree for every source LAN, it's way too
expensive. In stead, the router compute the tree only when needed and use
caching to achieve efficiency.

The router maintain MOSPF cache with the entries like: `(Ls, G, iif, MHV)`.

- `iif` means _incoming interface_.
- MHV is a vector with an entry per output link, i.e. a list of pairs
`(`![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda)`, min-hops)`.
- If a packet is received from S to G from the `iif`, the packet is sent over
  all links such that the time-to-live of the packet is at least the link's
  entry in min-hops.
- If no cache-entry of `(S, G)`, compute the tree on the fly (incurring delay).

__Another interesting point:__ If current router is not part of the tree, it
better adds an entry of infinity to the cache so that next time it does not
need to compute the whole tree again.

### Summary of MOSPF
- Pros:
    + If the link cost is not bi-directional, the MOSPF will still find the optimal
    path from source to receiver.
- Cons:
    + The first packet is delayed a lot. (compute tree at every hop)
    + Routers have to remember the receiver even though there are no sources.

## Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
Note that the dense version PIM is basically the same as DVMRP. We will focus
on sparse version PIM in this section.

### Motivation
> Flood and prune protocols discover receivers by sending packets everywhere,
> and pruning back when there are no receivers.

In reality, receivers and senders of are often sparsely populated.
Thus, flood and prune is inefficient in a very large internetwork (i.e. AS)

### Basic Idea

__Type of Trees:__ Use one Shared Tree (per group) used by all group receivers
and senders.

- Allows very large scale.
- All sources can send data via this tree
- All receivers receive data via this tree
- Routers only need to keep track of information for one tree

Note that __Shortest-Path Trees__ (one per (S,G) pair, rooted at S) are
possible (but not necessary).

__Receiver Driven__

- Trees are built using a form of _reverse-path forwarding_. Parent on the tree
  is the unicast next-hop to the root. (The tree is optimal backward just like
  DVMRP.)
- Explicit join/prune tree management
    - Routers with local (same LAN) receivers *send an explicit join* along the
      path to the root (wherever the root may be!)
    - *All routers along this path will join the multicast tree* (if not on it
      already).
    - *Prune messages remove tree branches* if receivers are no longer on their
      sub-tree.
    - __There are no join message in DVMRP, so DVMRP use some trick to
      determine which router is child.__

PIM is receiver driven and *unicast* protocol independent.
__Only knowledge of the next-hop to a destination is needed.__

### Rendezvous Point (RP)
The __root of the *shared tree*__ for group G is known as the *rendezvous
point* (RP) of G. Thus, the shared tree is also known as the RP tree of G.
Every router must know the RP for every group G by some means (broadcast or
something).

RP(G) denotes the unicast IP address of the RP of G

### Overall Steps

1. A receiver sends an IGMP message to its designated router (`DR`) wishing to
   join group _G_.
2. `DR` of receiver joins the shared tree rooted at `RP(G)`. Its join message
   indicates `(*,G)`, i.e., wishes data from all sources.
3. Source routers send multicast data messages to `RP(G)` via _encapsulation_.


#### RP Problem
- RP becomes a bottleneck. (Source send multicast message to RP(G))
- Overhead-encapsulate/decapsulate. (Source send multicast message via
  encapsulation)
- Indirect routing.

To solve these problems, we in stead build a shortest path tree rooted at the
designated router for _S_.

### Shortest Path Trees (SPT)
The __shortest path tree__ (SPT) for a source _S_ of a group _G_ is a tree
_rooted at the designated router_ for S. For every receiving host _R_, the path
between _R_ and _S_ is the __shortest path from *R* to *S*__.

_Note that the optimum path from __S__ to __R__ may not be the optimum path
from __R__ to __S__ if link costs are not bidirectional._

If the traffic from _S_ is high, the `RP(G)` may wish to avoid
encapsulation/decapsulation.

Due to traffic load, the _DR_ of a receiver may decide to join the SPT of _S_.
Thus, the DR will be connected to two trees, both shared tree and the SPT of
_S_. __Once messages arrive along the parent of the SPT of _S_, the router
_PRUNES_ itself from the Shared Tree.__ This prune is selective only for the
source _S_, data from other sources will continue to be received via the shared
tree.

### Pros and Cons

- Pros:
    + Good in sparsely populated networks (few receivers)
    + Only one tree is necessary (other trees for efficiency if desired)
- Cons:
    - If no sources are sending data right now, the routers still need to
      maintain information about the shared tree
    - The SPT is shortest from receiver to source, not from source to receiver.

# Inter-Domain Multicast Routing
Note that PIM-SM is a good candidate, since receivers are usually sparsely
located. But a single shared tree is not desirable. For example, if the
receiver and sender are in the same domain, but the RP is many domains away.
Building a single shared tree is way too expensive.

The solution is intuitive: one shared tree in each domain, and each domain has
its own RP.

The problem now becomes: How to find each source?

## Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
The receiver joins the tree of its local RP as before, and the sources send
data to their local RP. RPs use the _Multicast Source Discovery Protocol
(MSDP)_ to learn about each source.

MSDP runs in the RP at each domain. When a new source joins the RP, MSDP
informs all other domain RP’s of the new source in its domain.

Each MSDP router (i.e., each RP) maintains a TCP connection with the MSDP
router (i.e. the RP) of each neighboring domain.

# Source Specific Multicast (SSM)

Source Specific Multicast (SSM) is intended to *provide support for large-scale
multicast applications by extending the IP Multicast service model to support
__multicast channels__.*

__IP Multicast Channels__ is _a multicast channel is a datagram delivery
service identified by a tuple_ `(S,E)` _where_ `S` _is the sender’s IP address
(which is stored in the source IP address field of the IP header), and_ `E`  _is
the channel number (which is stored in the destination IP address field of the
IP header)._

It means only the source host `S` may send to `(S,E)`.

The receiver may prune itself from source, but would remember that there is a
source at this direction.
