## Two Orthogonal Axis
- When is the route found?

    | Proactive Protocols | Reactive Protocols |
    | --- | --- |
    | Continuously evaluate routes | On demand, route discovery by some global search |
    | No latency for data messages | Bottleneck for first data messages due to latency of route discovery|
    | Large capacity to keep network information current | Control messages only used when needed.

- Who determines route?
    - Destination (*hop-by-hop*) routing
        + Source specifies only destination in message header.
        + Intermediate nodes look at destination in header, consult internal
          tables to determin appropriate next hop.
        + Like Postal service.
    - Source (*path*) routing
        + Source specifies entire route: places complete path to destination in
        message header.

### Comparison

| Destination Routing | Source Routing |
| --- | --- |
| No source storage | Moderate source storage (entire route for each desired destination.) |
| Need intermediate node storage (table with routing instructions for destinations.) | No intermediate node storage (though cache might be used for efficiency) |
| Lower data message overhead (just destination in header) | Higher data message overhead (entire path in message header) |

## Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)

- Collection of mobile nodes forming a network.
- No centralized administration or standard support services.
- Highly co-operative, each host is an independent router.
- Hosts use wireless transceivers as network interface.
- *Network topology is dynamic* (frequent network changes).
- *Possible unidirectional links.*
- *Low bandwidth.*

# Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)

The content in this section is largely excerpted from [*Dynamic Source Routing
in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks*](../paper/dsr.pdf)

Basic idea:

- __On demand:__ No periodic router advertisements.
- __Source routing:__ To send a packet to another host, the sender constructs a
  _source route_ in the packet’s header, giving the address of each host in the
  network through which the packet should be forwarded in order to reach the
  destination host.
- __Caching:__ each mobile host participating in the ad-hoc network
  maintains a route cache in which it caches source routes
  (*avoid further router discoveries*). When one host sends a packet to another
  host, the sender first checks its route cache for a source route to the
  destination.
    + If a route is found, the sender uses this route to transmit the packet. 
    + If no route is found, the sender may attempt to discover one using the
      [___route discovery___](#route-discovery) protocol (*basically it does a
      flood*).
- Host monitors the correct operation of a route in use, we call this ___route
  maintenance___. When route maintenance detects a problem with a route in use,
  route discovery may be used again to discover a new, correct route to the
  destination.

## Route Discovery
Route discovery allows any host in the ad hoc network to dynamically discover a
route to any other host in the ad hoc network, whether directly reachable
within wireless transmission range or reachable through one or more
intermediate network hops through other hosts.

Assume __S__ broadcasts a __route request__ to __D__, route request contains:
route record (path followed), and request id (sequence number). Each node
forwards request by adding its own address to the route record and
re-broadcasting.

Requests propagate outward until:

- Target is found, or
- A node that has a route to D is found 
([Early Route Reply](#early-route-replies)).

__To forward or not to forward, that is the question! (RREQ)__

A request is forwarded if ___ALL___ below hold:

- Receiving node is not the destination.
- Receiving node has not seen request with same sequence number from this
  source. (_Forward each request only once to avoid broadcase storms, for
  efficiency._)
- Receiving node is not already listed in the route record. _It helps to
  prevnet sending the message again in case you forgot you have seen it
  before._
- IP TTL field may be used to limit scope.

In order to return the route reply packet to the initiator of the route
discovery, the target host must have a route to the initiator.

- If the target has an entry for this destination in its route cache, then it
  may send the route reply packet using this route in the same way as is used
  in sending any other packet.
- Otherwise, the target may reverse the route in the route record from the
  route request packet, and use this route to send the route reply packet.

However, network connections may not work equally well in both directions. An
alternative approach is for this host to
[__piggyback__](#piggybacking-on-route-discoveries) the route reply packet on a
route request targeted at the initiator of the route discovery to which it is
replying.

### Route Cache
All routes learned by a node are kept in Route Cache, to reduce the cost.

- Cache the route record of each route-request.
- Cache the path in each route-reply.
- Cache the path in each data packet.

Entries have limited lifetime. 

### Early Route-Replies
If intermediate node receives _RReq_ for _D_ and has entry for _D_ in route
cache, it responds to _RReq_ and does not propagate _RReq_ further.

This could reduces the overhead of route requests, and encourage the _expanding
ring_ search for route. For example search with `ttl = 1`.

### Some Optimization - Full Use of the Route Cache

#### Too Many Route Replies
A particular problem can occur, when several mobile hosts receive the
initiator’s broadcast of the route request packet, and all reply based on
routes found in their route caches.

We avoid the problems of many simultaneous replies and attempt to eliminate
replies indicating routes longer than the shortest reply, by causing each
mobile host to delay slightly before replying from its cache. Before replying
from its route cache, a host performs the following actions:

1. Pick a delay period 
   ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d=H\times\(h-1+r\)),
   where _h_ is the length in number of network hops for the route to be
   returned in this host’s reply, _r_ is a random number between 0 and 1, and
   _H_ is a small constant delay to be introduced per hop.
2. Delay transmitting the route reply from this host for a period of _d_.
3. Within this delay period, promiscuously receive all packets at this host. If
   a packet is received by this host during the delay period addressed to the
   target of this route discovery (the target is the final destination address
   for the packet, through any sequence of intermediate hops), and if the
   length of the route on this packet is less than _h_, then cancel the delay
   and do not transmit the route reply from this host; this host may infer that
   the initiator of this route discovery has already received a route reply,
   giving an equal or better route.

#### Loops in Route Replies
Another problem that can occur when hosts reply to route requests from their
cache, is the formation of a loop in the route sent in the route reply packet.
The route record in the route request cannot contain a loop, and no entry in a
route cache ever is set to a route containing a loop, yet the __concatenation of
the route record and the entry from the replying host’s route cache for the
target__ may contain a loop.

> In order to avoid this problem, if a host receives a route request and is not
> the target of the request but could reply from its cache, the host instead
> discards the request if the route in its reply would contain a loop; this
> restriction also implies that a host will only reply from its cache with a
> route in which the host itself is on the route, at the end of the route
> recorded in the route request packet and at the beginning of the path
> obtained from the host’s route cache.

#### Piggybacking on Route Discoveries
When one host needs to send a packet to another, if the sender does not have a
route cached to the destination host, it must initiate a separate route
discovery, either buffering the original packet until the route reply is
returned, or discarding it and relying on a higher-layer protocol to retransmit
it if needed.

With unidirectional links, path from _S_ to _D_ is not the same as from _D_
to _S_. Destination may need to discover a route to the source to deliver
__RRep__.

- If a route exists in its cache, use it.
- Otherwise, piggyback ___Route Reply___ onto new ___Route Request___. This is
  flooded towards source.

However, there is another problem in this method. If the route request is
received by some host and is replied to based on the host’s route cache (i.e.
__early route replies__), the piggybacked data would be lost when the host
discards the route request.

> In this case, before discarding the packet, the host must construct a new
> packet containing the piggybacked data from the route request packet, setting
> the route in this packet from the route being returned in the route reply.
> The route should appear as if the new packet had been sent by the initiator
> of the route discovery and had been forwarded normally to this host: the
> first portion of the route is taken from the accumulated route record in the
> route request packet, and the remainder of the route is taken from this
> host’s route cache. The sender address in the packet should also be set to
> the initiator of the route discovery.

#### Reflecting Shorter Routes
If hosts operate their network interfaces in promiscuous receive mode, then
_D_, as shown in figure 3 below, may hear the transmission from _B_ to _C_, _D_
may infer that route may be shortened to exclude the intermediate hop through
C. _D_ then sends an __unsolicited route reply packet__ to the original sender
of the packet, informing it that it can now reach D in one hop from B.

### Exponential Backoff
If a destination is not reachable a large number of unproductive route request
packets would be propagated throughout the subset of the ad hoc network
reachable from this host. In order to reduce the overhead from such route
discoveries, we use exponential backoff to limit the rate at which new route
discoveries may be initiated from any host for the same target.

## Route Maintenance
While a route is in use, the route maintenance procedure monitors the operation
of the route and informs the sender of any routing errors.
Node "upstream" is in charge of detecting failure.

Link status/breakage may be detected using:

- link-layer ACKs (MACAW RTS/CTS/ACK),
- passive ACKs (overhearing the transmission of your packet at the next hop)
- DSR ACK request (Send a DSR packet asking for an ACK)

# Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR)

The content in this section is largely excerpted from [*Optimized Link State
Routing Protocol for Ad Hoc
Networks*](../paper/olsr.pdf)

First thing first, a quick review of Link-State Routing

- Each node periodically floods status of its neighboring links.
- Each node re-broadcasts link state information received from its neighbour.
- Each node keeps track of link state information received from other nodes.
- Each node uses above information to determine next hop to each destination.

OLSR inherits stability of like-state protocol. But is use selective flooding
(_only MPR retransmit control messages,_ minimizing flooding), which makes it
suitable for large and dense networks

Besides, due to the proactive nature, OLSR has an advantage of having route
immediately available when needed.

## Multipoing Relays (MPRs)

The idea is to minimize the flooding of broadcast messages. Each node in the
network selects a set of neighboring nodes to retransmits its packet. The set
is called _MPRs_.

- Each node selects its MPRs among its _one hop_ neighbors.
- __The set must cover all the nodes that are two hops away.__
- Every node in the two hop neighborhood of node _N_ must have a bidirectional
  link towards _MPR(N)_.

Note that, multipoint relays are selected among one hop neighbors with a
bidirectional link. Therefore, selecting route through multipoint relays
automatically avoids the problems associated with data packets transfer on
unidirectional links.

The information required to calculate the MPRs:

- The set of one-hop neighbors and the two-hop neighbors.
- There are many ways you can select MPRs from your neighbors.

_MPR Selector (MS) is a neighboring node which has selected me as an MPR._

The key point is: __not all nodes forward the flood, nonetheless the flood
reaches _all nodes_.__

### How-to
To obtain the information about one-hop neighbors:
> __Use `HELLO` message (received by all one-hop neighbors).__

To obtain the information about two-hop neighbors:
> __Each node attaches the list of its own neighbors.__

Once a node has its one and two-hop neighbor sets: 
> _It can select a MPRs which covers all its two-hop neighbors._

### Neighbor Sensing

Each node periodically broadcasts its `HELLO` messages. These are received by
all one-hop neighbors, but they are not relayed to further node.

A `HELLO` message contains:

1. List of bidirectional neighbors.
2. list of one directional neighbors (the list of addresses of the neighbors
   which are heard by this node, i.e. received `HELLO` message from, but the
   link is not yet validated as bidirectional.)
3. MPR set. In the first round, there is no MPR set, since there is no neighbor
   from the node's perspective.

Note that, if a node finds its own address in a `HELLO` message, it consider
the link to the sender as bidirectional.

### Neighbor Table
Each node records the information about its one hop neighbors, the status of
the link with these neighbor and a list of two hop neighbors that these one hop
neighbors give access to.

Entry in the neighbor table has a holding time. Upon expiry of holding time, it
is removed.

The neighbor table also contains a sequence number value which specifies the
most recent MPR set Every time a node updates its MPR set, this sequence number
is incremented. _This is because you tell your neighbors about your own MPR set
(distinguish old from new)._

Example of neighbor table is shown below.

- One-hop neighbor table.

    | Neighbor’s id | State of Link |
    | --- | --- |
    | A | Bidirectional |
    | G | Unidirectional |
    | C | MPR |

- Two-hop neighbor table.

    | Neighbor’s id | Access though |
    | --- | --- |
    | E | C |
    | D | C |

### Multipoint Relay Selection
Each node in the network selects independently its own set of multipoint
relays.

Multipoint relays of a given node are declared in the subsequence `HELLO`s
transmitted by this node. The multipoint set is re-calculated when:

- a change in the neighborhood is detected when either a bidirectional link
  with a neighbor fails or a new neighbor with a bidirectional links is added.
- a change in the two-hop neighbor set with bidirectional link is detected.

On reception of `HELLO` message, each node can construct its _MPR Selector
table_ with the nodes who have selected it as a multipoint relay. A sequence
number is also associated with the MPR selector table.

## The Link-State Routing Part

Every node periodically broadcasts (i.e. a flood in the whole network) its MPR
Selector Set (MS), i.e., tell the whole network who has chosen you as an MPR.
The node DON’T mention its whole list of neighbors.

### MPR Information Declaration - Building the Topology
In order to build intra-forwarding databased needed for routing packet, each
node periodically broadcast specific control message called _Topology Control_
(`TC`) messages to declare its __MPR selector__ set.

- Nodes with a non-empty MPR selector periodically flood their MS via a TC
  message.
- Message might not be sent if there are no updates.
- Message contains: a) MPR Selector set (MS); b) Sequence number.

Each node maintains a __Topology Table__ based on TC messages. And routing
tables are calculated based on __Topology table__. An entry in the topology
table consists of

- an address of a (potential) destination (an MPR selector in the received `TC`
  message),
- address of a last-hop to that destination (originator of the `TC` message),
- the corresponding MPR selector set sequence number (of the sender node).

It implies that the destination node can be reached in the last hop through
this last-hop node. An example of entry in _Topology Table_ is shown below. X
selected Y as one of its MPRs, so X is in the MPR Selector set of Y.

| Destination Address | Last-Hop to the Destination (Destination’s MPR) | MPR Selector Sequence Number | Holding Time |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| X | Y (Originator of a `TC` msg.) | ... | ... |

__Upon receipt of TC message from Y:__ (Quote from slide)

- If there exist some entry to the same destination X with __higher__ Sequence
  Number, the `TC` message is ignored. 

  The paper states in the other way:

  > If there exist some entry in the topology table whose __last-hop address__
  > corresponds to the __originator of the `TC` message__ and the MPR selector
  > sequence number in that entry is ___greater___ than the sequence number in
  > the received message, then no further processing of this `TC` message is
  > done and it is silently discarded.

  We can see that these two statements are equivalent, though in different
  perspective. The paper focus on the originator of the message, i.e. the
  last-hop to destination, while the slide focus on the destinations, i.e. the
  MPR selector set in the `TC` message.

- If there exist some entry to the same destination X with __lower__ Sequence
  Number, the topology entry is removed and the new one is recorded.

  Like above, the paper states in the other way:

  > If there exist some entry in the topology table whose __last-hop address__
  > corresponds to the __originator of the `TC` message__ and the MPR selector
  > sequence number in that entry is ___smaller___ than the sequence number in
  > the received message, then that topology table entry is removed.

- If the entry (i.e. X, Y) is the _same_ as in TC message, the holding time of
  this entry is refreshed.
- If X is no longer in MS of Y, remove entry (X, Y). (_Note that, this one is a
  bit redundant, since the entry is already removed in the second bullet._)
- If there are __no__ corresponding entry – the new entry (X, Y) is recorded.

  The paper state the last three point more clearer as follow:

  > For each of the MPR selector address received in the `TC` message:
  >
  > - If there exist some entry in the topology table whose destination address
  >   corresponds to the MPR selector address and the last-hop address of that
  >   entry corresponds to the originator address of the `TC` message, then the
  >   holding time of that entry is refreshed.
  > - Otherwise, a new topology entry is recorded in the topology table.

### Routing Table Calculation

Each node maintains a __routing table__ (in addition to the topology table) to
all known destinations in the network. The nodes which receive a `TC` message
parse and store some of the _connected pair_ of form `[last-hop, node]` where
`nodes` are the address found in the `TC` message list. Routing table is based
on the information contained in the ___neighbor table and the topology
table___.

Consider the destination sent out a flood that reached every node. The message
reached the source, of course. The message would be forwarded by the
destination's MPRs, and the MPR of the MPRs. Eventually, along the path the
message was transfers from destination to source. Each node is the MPR of the
previous node.

> __ALL INTERMEDIATE NODES ARE MPR’s OF SOME NODE (y is mpr of x),__ MPR’s
> form a ___backbone___ network so to speaks.

1. All the entries of routing table are removed.
2. The new entries are recorded in the table starting with one hop neighbors
   (_h_=1) as destination nodes. For each neighbor entry in the neighbor table,
   whose link status is not unidirectional, a new route entry is recorded in
   the routing table where destination and next-hop addresses are both set to
   address of the neighbor and distance is set to 1.
3. then the new route entries for destination nodes _h_+1 hops away are
   recorded in the routing table. The following procedure is executed for each
   value of _h_, starting with _h_=1 and incrementing it by 1 each time. The
   execution will stop if no new entry is recorded in an iteration.

   For each topology entry in topology table, if its destination address does
   not corresponds to destination address of any route entry in the routing
   table __AND__ its last-hop address corresponds to destination address of a
   route entry with distance equal to _h_, then a new route entry is recorded
   in the routing table where:
   - destination is set to destination address in topology table;
   - next-hop is set to next-hop of the route entry whose destination is equal
     to above mentioned last-hop address; and
   - distance is set to _h_+1.

## Summary on OLSR

### Table Used in the Protocol
| Neighbor Table | Topology Table | Routing Table |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| 1-hop neighbor | Dest Hop/Prev Hop | For every destination, who is my next hop? |
| 2-hop neighbor | X / Y ||
| MPR set | A / Y ||

### Sequence Number Used in the Protocol

- Seq # for MPR set
- Seq # for MPR selector set (MS)
- Seq # for the flood (typical seq # for link-state)

### Conclusion

- __OLSR protocol is proactive or table driven in nature.__
- Advantages
    + Route immediately available
    + Minimize flooding by using MPR
- OLSR protocol is suitable for large and dense networks.
- Disadvantages
    + It does not guarantee an optimal path consider the bandwidth.
    + Lot of control overhead if only a few pairs of nodes wish to communicate.
