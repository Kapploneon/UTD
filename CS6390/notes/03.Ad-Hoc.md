# Ad-Hoc Routing
or called Mobile Routing.
## Routing Overview
### Two Orthogonal Axis
- When is the route found?

    | Proactive Protocals | Reactive Protocols |
    | --- | --- |
    | Continuously evaluate routes | On demand, route discovery by some global search |
    | No latency for data messages | Bottleneck for first data messages due to latency of route discovery|
    | Large capacity to keep network information current | Control messages only used when needed.

- Who determines route?
    - Destination (*hop-by-hop*) routing
        + Source specifies only destination in message header.
        + Intermediate nodes look at destination in header, consult internal tables
        to determin appropriate next hop.
        + Like Postal service.
    - Source (*path*) routing
        + Source specifies entire route: places complete path to destination in
        message header.

    | Destination Routing | Source Routing |
    | --- | --- |
    | No source storage | Moderate source storage (entire route for each desired dest.) |
    | Need intermediate node storage (table with routing instructions for destinations.) | No intermediate node storage |
    | Lower data message overhead | Higher data message overhead |

### Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)

- Collection of mobile nodes forming a network.
- No centralized administration or standard support services.
- Highly co-operative, each host is an independent router.
- Hosts use wireless transceivers as network interface.
- *Network topology is dynamic* (frequent network changes).
- *Possible unidirectional links.*
- *Low bandwidth.*

## Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)

Basic idea:

- __On demand:__ No periodic router advertisements.
- __Source routing:__ to send a packet to another host, the sender constructs a
  source route in the packetâ€™s header
- If no route found in the cache, the sender may attempt to discover one using
  the ___route discovery protocol___ (*basically it does a flood*).
- __Caching:__ each mobile host participating in the ad-hoc network
  maintains a route cache in which it caches source routes
  (*avoid further router discoveries*)
- Host monitors the correct operation of a route in use, we call this ___route
  maintenance___.

### Route Discovery
Assume __S__ broadcasts a route-request to __D__,
route request contains: route record (path followed), and request id (sequence
number). Each node forwards request by adding its own address to the route
record and re-broadcasting.

Requests propagate outward until:

- Target is found, or
- A node that has a route to D is found 
([Early Route Reply](#early-route-replies)).

__To forward or not to forward, that is the question! (RREQ)__

A request is forwarded if ___ALL___ below hold:

- Receiving node is not the destination
- Receiving node has not seen request with same sequence number from this
  source. (_Forward each request only once to avoid broadcase storms, for
  efficiency._)
- Receiving node is not already listed in the route record. _It helps to
  prevnet sending the message again in case you forgot you have seen it
  before._
- IP TTL field may be used to limit scope.

#### Route Cache
All routes learned by a node are kept in Route Cache.

- Cache the route record of each route-request.
- Cache the path in each route-reply.
- Cache the path in each data packet.

Entries have limited lifetime. 

#### Early Route-Replies
If intermediate node receives _RReq_ for _D_ and has entry for _D_ in route
cache, it responds to _RReq_ and does not propagate _RReq_ further.

#### Unidirectional Links
With unidirectional links, path from _S_ to _D_ is not the same as from _D_
to _S_. Destination may need to discover a route to the source to deliver
__RRep__.

- If a route exists in its cache, use it.
- Otherwise, piggyback Route Reply onto new Route Request.
    - This is flooded towards source.
    - _This should not be terminated by an early route reply_, since the
      request contains a reply in it.
