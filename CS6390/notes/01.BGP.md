## Stable Path Problem (SPP)
An instance S of the stable paths problem is a triple,

> ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?S=\(G,\mathcal{P},\Lambda\)) 

- ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?G) is the network graph.
  We assume that node 0, called the origin, is special in that it is the
  destination to which all other nodes attempt to establish a path.
- ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathcal{P}) is the set of
  permitted paths.
  A path in is either the empty path, denoted by 
  ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\epsilon), or a sequence of
  nodes,
  ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(v_kv_{k-1}\ldots{v_1}v_0)), such
  that all edges are in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E)
- ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Lambda) is the ranking function of
  the permitted paths.

A path assignment is a function ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pi)
that maps each node to a path. A path assignment is stable at a node when the
assignment is the best ranking route current node is able to choose.

A SPP *S* is solvable iff there is a stable path assignment of *S*.Otherwise,
*S* is called *unsolvable*. 
A stable routing tree *T* is called a solution for the specification *S*.
Note that __some
nodes may have an empty path in a given solution__, that is if a node only have
empty path currently, then the path assignment is the empty path.

An SPP instance is said to converge iff from all
possible initial states, and all possible executions from those states, a
solution is always reached. __Solvable does not imply convergence.__

## Solving SPP
[Griffin and Wilfong](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=316231) have shown that
statically detecting solvability for real-world BGP is NP-hard.
Similarly, the basic question of solvability is still
NP-complete for the more abstract model of SPVP.

We introduce two similar structure *dispute cycle* and *dispute wheel*.

### Dispute Cycle (Dispute Digraph)
There are two kinds of arcs in the dispute digraph, __transmission arcs__ and
__dispute arcs__.

- Suppose that nodes *u* and *v* are peers. If *Q* is a permitted path at *v*
  and *P* is a permitted path at *u*, then a dispute arc from path *Q* to path
  *P*, denoted ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q\rightarrow{P}),
  represents a local policy dispute between peers *u* and *v* concerning the
  relative ranking of paths *P* and *Q*.
  Formal definition is as follow:
    + *P* is a permitted path from *u* to 0 with next-hop *v*,
    + *Q* is a path from *v* to 0, permitted at *v*,
    + Path *(u,v)Q* is rejected at *u*, or has a lower preference than *P*.
    + *P[v,0]* has lower preference than *Q*.

  The following figure illustrates the condition.

  ![disputearc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanlin-he/UTD/master/CS6390/notes/fig/disputearc.png)

  Dispute arc is denoted in solid arcs.

- There is a *transmission arc* from *vP* to *(u,v)P*, when nodes *u* and *v*
  are peers, *vP* is permitted at *v* , and *(u,v)P* is permitted at *u*.
  Transmission arc is denoted in dotted arcs.

We usually refer to cycles in the dispute digraph as *dispute cycles*.

__Lemma 1.__ _Any dispute cycle must contain at least two dispute arcs._

### Dispute Wheel

While dispute cycles are built from local relationships between the ranking
functions of peers, dispute wheels are based on *long distance* relationships.

A __dispute wheel__,
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Pi=\(U,\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{R}\)),
of size *k*, is a set of nodes
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?U=\\{{u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{k-1}\\}),
and sets of paths
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathcal{Q}=\\{Q_0,Q_1\ldots,Q_{k-1}\\}),
and
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathcal{R}=\\{R_0,R_1\ldots,R_{k-1}\\}),
such that for each
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0\leq{i}\leq{k-1}) we have

1. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R_i) is a path from
   ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?u_i) to 
   ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?u_{i+1}),
1. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q_i\in\mathcal{P}^{u_i}),
1. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R_iQ_{i+1}\in\mathcal{P}^{u_i}),
1. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lambda^{u_i}\(Q_i\)\leq\lambda^{u_i}\(R_iQ_{i+1}\))_

![disputearc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanlin-he/UTD/master/CS6390/notes/fig/disputewheel.png)

__Lemma 2.__ _Every dispute wheel contains a minimal sub-wheel._

__Lemma 3.__ _If the dispute digraph contains a cycle, then S has a dispute wheel._

__Theorem 1.__ _If a specification __S__ has more than one solution, then it
has a dispute wheel._

__Theorem 2.__ _Let __S__ be an SPVP specification. If __S__ has no dispute
wheel, then __S__ is solvable._

Note that no dispute wheel is a sufficient but not necessary condition.

In general, an SPVP specification may have more than one solution. In this case
the dispute digraph has a cycle. To simplify proof, assume that all solutions
of _S_ are spanning tree (it does not have to be).
For any specification _S_, we can construct an essentially equivalent
specification ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\hat{S}) all of whose
solutions are spanning trees.

Some key points:

- Some solutions have some nodes with an empty path (not a spanning tree). We
  modify the SPP instance by adding an additional node *x*, and adding for each
  node *u*, the path (*u x 0*), that is ranked lowest among all paths at *u*.
  It is obvious that the solution remains the same, except no one has an empty
  path.
- A path P is said to be __consistent with tree__ *T* if once P encounters a node
  in *T*, the rest of P is along *T*.
- A path P is said to be __direct path to tree__ *T* if it is consistent with
  tree *T* and the node next to the starting point is in *T*.

Each time, consider any node *u* not in *T* such that has a direct path into
*T*, and is the highest ranking among those paths. If such *u* is found, add
*u* to *T*. Otherwise, "stuck", means there is a dispute wheel.

#### Observation
Since each time when we try to 
add a node u if out of all the ''consistent'' paths of u, the highest ranked
one goes directly into the tree.

- Node *x* is on the tree.
- Any node not on tree has at least one consistent path directly into the tree.
- An execution could contain one or more cycles, but still end in a stable
  state.
- If we eliminate cycles, we FORCE convergence!

After construction, *T* is a stable spanning tree (since every step in
construction yields a stable tree)

### Next Objective

We want to prove:
> If there is a cycle C, then exists a dispute wheel.
> (Originally we try to prove: *If there is not dispute wheel, then there is no cycle. => Converge.*)


__Definition:__ A node *u* is *changing* in *C* if in two states in *C*, it has
different paths. Otherwise, *u* if *fixed*.

**Lemma 4.**  Let __i.__ *u* be a node that is not fixed in *C*,
__ii__ *P* be a path that is taken by *u* in *C*,
__iii__ and *v* is the first *fixed node* of *P*.
Then, each non-fixed node *w* in *P*[*u,v*], chooses the path *P*[*w,0*] in some state in
C.

Note that w does not necessarily need to choose that same path as u at the
moment. The lemma only implies that at some previous state, w has chosen that
path.

Based on the lemma, it is intuitively easy to prove the theorem.

__Theorem 3.__ If there is a cycle C in an execution, then there exists a dispute
wheel (no dispute wheel implies no cycles, and hence, convergence).

## Stable Internet Routing Without Global Coordination
Some problems:

- Too much overhead to maintain path histories (dynamic execution solution).
- Difficult to gather all policies and check for cycles in dispute graphs.
- Can we select some practical guidelines?
    - If the guidelines are followed, the system is stable.
- Their approach: hierarchies
    - You avoid circular conflicts by introducing hierarchies of nodes.
    - Policies are based on the hierarchy,

There are three types of policies:

- __Import policy:__ of the paths offered by my neighbors, which ones will I allow?
- __Path Selection:__ given the paths offered by my neighbors which satisfy my
  import policy, which one do I like the best?
- __Export Policy:__ given my current path, will I tell my neighbor of this path or
  tell my neighbor that I have no path?

Note that a path is allowed in an "SPP instance" only if it exists in the
export policy of my neighbour and in my import policy.

### Neighbor Relation
- provider-to-customer
- peer-to-peer
- backup-link

Provider-to-customer edges must form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
However, in terms of peer-to-peer, any body can be peer to any body else.

The customer-provider and peer-to-peer agreements translate into several rules
governing BGP export policies:

- Exporting to a provider: In exchanging routing information with a
    provider:
    - An AS can only export its networks and the routes of its customers.
    - However, it can not export routes learned from other provider or
        peers.
    - That is, an AS does not provide transit services for its provider.
- Exporting to a peer: In exchanging routing information with a peer: same
    restrictions.
- Exporting to a customer: In exchanging routing information with a
    customer:
    - An AS can export everything: its customer routes, as well as routes
        learned from its providers and peers. 
    - That is, an AS does provide transit services for its customers.

In conclusion: A node can export to its peer and to its provider only paths that it has
learned from its customers

**Lemma 5:** A path exported by a provider g to a customer h can only be
subsequently exported by providers to their customers (exported via provider ->
customer edges).
- If g exports the path to h, h cannot export it to y nor to x, h can export to
  y or x only a path via a customer
- You can repeat the argument between h and i, etc.

__Guide line A:__ _Must prefer customer paths over those of peers and providers_

__Theorem 4:__
For a BGP system that has only customer-provider and peer-to-peer relationships
(no backup links), if all ASms follow guideline A, and the provider-customer
graph is acyclic, and the export policies are respected, then the BGP system is
inherently safe (always converges).

__Proof:__
First, these two statements are the same. We will prove the latter one.

- All three properties satisfied => No dispute wheel.
- Dispute wheel exists => at least one of properties violated.


#### Some Remark
If links and or nodes are added.deleted, or if the policies change, as long as
they satisfy the given requirements, the system will remain stable.

## Path Selection Policy
If we have multiple BGP speakers per AS then, path selection is as follows:

1. Choose the greatest `local_pref`
1. Choose the least AS hops.
1. Choose the lowest `MED` value
1. Choose the least internal cost to border router.
1. Choose the lowest peer IP address.
