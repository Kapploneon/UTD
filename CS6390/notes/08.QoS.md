# Quality of Service

Realtime applications require __deliver on time__ assurances (muse come from
_inside_ the network)

How to achieve timely delivery?

- When one-way delay is small (< 1/3) relative to acceptable delay
    + Sent packets will arrive on timely
    + If lost, a packet has enough time to be retransmitted.
- When one-way delay is large (> 1) relative to acceptable delay
    + Impossible for retransmitted packets to arrive on time.
- Otherwise, packets _may_ arrive on time and __no possibility of
  retransmission__.

We can reduce the one-way delay by having faster links and/or prioritizing
traffic. However, one-way delay cannot be less than propagation delay.

- Within the 48-state U.S., one-way propagation-delay peeks around 25 msec.
- Humans notice about 50 msec delay for voice (not much chance for
  retransmission).





# Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)

> Just like FQ...

Each flow _f_ is assigned a weight _Wf_. There is a fake server and a real
server. The bandwidth given to the flow in the fake server is proportional to
its weight,

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{W_f}{\sum_xW_x}\times{C}),

where C is the rate of the output channel, and the sum is over the set of
“backlogged flows” in the fake server (more on this later).

> FQ is WFQ with _w_ < 1 for all flow.

Real server forwards one packet at a time:

- It assigns timestamps to packets
- Packets are sent out in order of timestamp
- The timestamp is the “virtual” finishing time of the packet at the fake
  server

Bit-by-bit server forwards a few bits of each flow at a time (i.e. fractions of
a packet)

The virtual time V(t) at real time t is the _bit number_ or _round-number_ in
the fake bit-by-bit server at real time t. It is computed as follows

- Simple FQ: increase V(t) by 1 every time you forward one bit from ALL queued
  flows in the bit-by-bit server,
- WFQ: increase V(t) by 1 every time you forward _Wf_ bits from every queued
  flow _f_ in the bit-by-bit server.
- Thus, V(t) increases faster over time if there are less flows queued in the
  bit-by-bit server.

The _bit by bit round-robin service_ is therefore faster for flows with greater
weight.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_{f,i}) (timestamp of _i_-th packet of
flow _f_) is the virtual (i.e. __fake__) time when the _i_-th packet of f exits
the fake server.

> ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_{f,i}=\max\(V\(A_{f,i}\),F\)+L_{f,i}/W_f)


Does the real scheduler forward packets bt smallest _D_ first?
