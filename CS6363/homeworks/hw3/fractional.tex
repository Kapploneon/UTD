\begin{homeworkProblem}[Fractional Jewelry Collection]

\begin{homeworkSubProblem}[Algorithm Description]

Each time, take the whole jewelry with the largest $V[i]/S[i]$ value,
until the bag's space is insufficient for the next whole jewelry.
And then, cut the next largest $V[i]/S[i]$ value jewelry to fit
the remaining bag's space and take it. As a result, the total value
in the bag will be optimal.

\end{homeworkSubProblem}

\begin{homeworkSubProblem}[Proof of Correctness]

\begin{proof}
Divide the bag into $b$ units with each unit size of $1$.

Assume each unit is the minimal size to fill,
and each time we cut a piece of one jewelry of a unit size
to put in the bag. Putting a whole jewelry into the bag equals
to putting all its pieces with unit size into the bag.

Based on the description of part a, 
each time we put a piece into the bag, its value
must be the largest among the remaining jewelry pieces,
since the pieces with bigger value has already been taken.

Assume there is a optimal solution other than the greedy solution
described in part a. Then, there is a unit size jewelry piece different
in the choosing order,
and its value should be larger than the piece chosen in the greedy
solution. However, all jewelry with larger value has already been taken
in the greedy solution. Thus, it cause a contradiction.

In conclusion, the greedy solution described in part a is optimal.
