## About the [Note](./notes/notes.pdf)
The notes are lecture notes taken from **CS6363: Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms** taught by Benjamin Raichel
at University of Texas at Dallas in Fall 2016.

The first part of the note is generally based on the famous CLRS, though they are still the copy from instructor's mysterious notebook.
The latter part (starting from graph algorithm) is basically the same as
[Jeff Erickson's Lecture Notes](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/),
which Benjamin strongly recommended as off-class additional reading material.

Taking note in Ben's class is a pleasant experience, though there might be some times
in the semester you cannot read the note on blackboard.
I hope this note would help you, if you are taking the same class as I did.
I wish you receive a good grade in this course and all other courses in the future.


## About the Homework
There are normally 4 homeworks in this course. The solution is not all correct,
but I think most of them are. Some problem comes with side notes taken after professor reviewing
the homework in class.

The homework usually changed in each semester. It is much wiser to review the notes rather than the homework.
